Welcome to Nguyen brothers' data structures and algorithms class. You can find here information about class outline, schedule, exercises, and more.

# Goals
Data structures & algorithms is one of the most important topic in computer science. To solve any computing problems, you need to design, or model, the input and output data, then come up with algorithms to solve the problem correctly, fast, and efficiently.

This class' main goal is to teach you common data structures and algorithms, algorithm analysis and design.

This class' secondary goal is to teach you enough Python programming and basic understanding of how computers work to follow class examples and exercises. Independent (self) learning on those topics is recommended.

# Prerequisites
None. The class will use Python for examples and exercises. No prior Python knowledge is require

# Class Format
Online Zoom class every Wednesday and Sunday evening.

# Home Works
Homeworks are expected to submit in 2 days after each class.
